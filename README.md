# Kubernetes


Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google and later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes provides a robust framework for container orchestration, making it easier to deploy and manage applications at scale.
